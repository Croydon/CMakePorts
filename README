>>> Introduction

CMakePorts is a small custom project to provide a simple framework for the
installation of – predominantly – scientific software packages across several
platforms; it uses CMake as tool to handle the configuration, build and
installation, as well as keeping track of package dependencies (somewhat similar
to MacPorts).
